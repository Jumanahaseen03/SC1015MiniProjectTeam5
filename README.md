# SC1015MiniProjectTeam5

## About
This project aims to provide insights into real estate pricing trends in King County, Washington. Using historical sales data, we explore the impact of various factors such as property features and location on housing prices, with a focus on assisting potential buyers like Lucas in making informed decisions.
